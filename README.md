# General Scripts
A repository for useful, short, and sweet code (as well as SSI's Coding and GitHub SOP). Meant for one-off scripts that accept a robust amount of inputs to produce standard results, such as, Seasonal Mann-Kendall, summary statistics, ecological diversity statistics. All scripts in thise repository MUST be written for use by a general audience (non-coding staff). Don't upload scripts that the layperson couldn't use.

* Contents *
- Coding and GitHub SOP
- Trend Analysis (Seasonal Mann Kendall)
- BMI Diversity Calculator (Shannon and other common diversity indices)
